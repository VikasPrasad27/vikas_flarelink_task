# Task Manager Application

## 1. Application and Functionality

This **Task Manager** application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by:

- Adding tasks with a title and priority (High, Medium, Low).
- Viewing the list of tasks with the date they were added.
- Marking tasks as completed by checking a box.
- Sorting tasks based on priority, name, or date.
- Searching for tasks by their title.
- Deleting tasks when no longer needed.
- Storing tasks locally in the browser so they persist across sessions.

The app is built using **React** for the frontend, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. It is styled using CSS for a clean and modern look.
